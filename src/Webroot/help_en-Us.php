<h2>Thank you</h2>
A project isn't just about a bunch of coders. It's the users that take it out into the world and inspire us to do more. I would like to thank a few people who made a difference to this project,
<dl>
<dt>Andrei Virlan</dt>
	<dd>For giving this project the initial push. He is the reason I support multiple languages.</dd>
<dt>Laurentiu Nicola (GrayShade)</dt>
	<dd>For being there. I really mean that. And for helping users troubleshoot their issues when I wasn't around.</dd>
<dt>HeyItsMe</dt>
	<dd>For constantly prodding me to get off my bottom and release the next version already. I would've quit at 0.7 if it weren't for him. And also for his really neat ideas and feature-requests. He is without doubt the most active user.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<dl>
<dt>When I try to search, I get "No Index Found" error.</dt>
	<dd>Your index hasn't been created yet. Try after some time. If it still occurs, then there's a problem. Mail me your log file.</dd>
